            <li>
                Set aside 2 tablespoons of flour. In a large, roomy bowl, 
                mix the remaining flour with the cornstarch and baking powder. 
                Season lightly with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.

                Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the 
                sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing 
                until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter 
                in the fridge to rest for between 30 minutes and 1 hour.

                Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than 
                1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide 
                chips. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold 
                running water.

                Heat the oil to 350 F in a deep-fat fryer or large, deep saucepan.
                 Cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the fat for about 2 
                 minutes. Do not brown them. Once the chips are slightly cooked, 
                 remove them from the fat and drain. Keep to one side.

                Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each 
                fillet into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the 
                batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets from time to time with 
                a large slotted spoon.
