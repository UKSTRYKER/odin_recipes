            <li>
                In a frying pan, heat the vegetable oil on medium heat and add 
                the onion to cook for approximately 7 minutes, or until it starts 
                to lightly brown.  
            </li>
            <img src="../images/sausagerolls/step2.jpeg" alt="bowl with a mixture of meat, onion, eggs,
            black pepper and salt.">
            <li>
                n a large mixing bowl, add the sausage meat, cooked onion, and 2 
                of the eggs. Season with a couple of pinches of black pepper and 
                a good sprinkling of salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are 
                thoroughly and evenly combined.

            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out 
                the pastry into two 8- by 10-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle 
                into 2 long strips (4 total) and rest them in the fridge for at 
                least 10 minutes. 
            </li>
            <img src="../images/sausagerolls/step4.jpeg" alt="pastry with sausage mixture spread down the middle
            with room on either side to wrap the pastry around it.">
            <li>
                Place the cold pastry onto 2 lightly greased baking pans. In the 
                center of each pastry, form the sausage meat into a long sausage 
                the length of the pastry strip. Beat the remaining egg in a small 
                bowl and lightly brush the edges of the pastry.

            <li>
                Fold the pastry over the meat filling to form long rolls. Flip the 
                sausage roll over so the seam is underneath. Lightly brush the top 
                surface with egg.

            <li>
                Cut the rolls into 1 1/2-inch lengths. Or vary the length to the 
                style of roll you want. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
                Leave them to cool before packing them into your picnic basket or 
                lunch box, or simply eat them right away. Enjoy.
